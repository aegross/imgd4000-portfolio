# Lessons Learned from the Project
At the time of writing this (4/30/2024), this is the largest game that I've ever worked on. It's also one of the largest group projects that I've been a part of in general. I'm incredibly proud to have been a part of the team! Even though I had to prioritize other work this term and couldn't dedicate as much time to the project as I would have liked, I'm proud of the work I've done.

I learned a lot about working in Unreal from being a developer for the project. It was highly beneficial to learn how to use a tool which is standard in the industry in the context of a full project rather than small assignments. Additionally, I was able to gain practical experience working with visual programming (blueprints), which I typically avoid and haven't used since high school. Working on a fully fleshed-out project also allowed me to get a feel for the entire game development pipeline, from idea to final product, on a small scale.

## Specific Skills
### Using Git (and GitHub) with Unreal
Despite inconvenient file management choices on the engine side, Git still works with Unreal as long as the developer(s) are concious of what files are being modified at the points when they work. For a small-scale project such as _Sleeping with the Roaches_, good communication between members of the dev team was all, aside from good commit practices, that was really necessary to make Git and GitHub work for us. Our method of project management wouldn't be possible on a large-scale project, but it was still effective and informative regardless. I learned how Unreal interfaces with Git, and how to set up a repository for an Unreal project.

### Interacting with Unreal's Input System, and Parts of a Custom Character Controller
I learned about character controllers and all the necessary parts of them from the other members of the team, while implementing parts of it (grounding checks) myself. Additionally, I was able to gain experience with writing functions that directly interfaced with the character controller code.
